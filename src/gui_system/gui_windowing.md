# GUI Windowing

Floating windows are always to be on top of tabbed elements. All windows will be dockable and have a docking system inside them.
The system will have a collection of window elements currently "alive" (in the future, this system should be interfacing with an entity system).


### Background Window
An immovable dockable window in the back that other windows can dock into.

# Font layout
Maybe it would be interesting to do a markdown-like language parser for the text formating
